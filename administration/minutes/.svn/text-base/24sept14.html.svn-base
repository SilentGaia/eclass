Figuring out what features customer wants in E-classroom project
<br><br><em>- This tool is not about having fancy editing tools for lecture, but about interacting with everyone in the classroom</em>
<br><br><em>- should support spectrum of lectures and and lab, powerpoint</em>
<br><br><em>- Assuming everyone has a computer in the classroom</em>
<br><br><em>- should have a lock down mode - all you see is lecture, cannot use other applications, students are able to to take notes</em>
<br><br><em>- students can scribble on lecture notes itself and about to be saved</em>
<br><br><em>- free mode: you can bring up whatever you want, browse, etc. (act like a typical computer)</em>
<br><br><em>- teacher should have a roster and decide what students can do</em>
<br><br><em>- everyone should be provided of drawing tools</em>
<br><br><em>- should have ink and layer slider (like what Photoshop provides)</em>
<br><br><em>- make notes like a sticky note type of concept</em>
<br><br><em>- lecture building should be simple: html format</em>
<br><br><em>- lecture edits should provide topics, subtopics, images, text</em>
<br><br><em>- teacher should have ability to move powerpoint slides, make notes for all students to see</em>
