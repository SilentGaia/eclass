<em>Round 2 of discussion with customer.</em>
<ol type=1>
SCO requests

specific requests 
-> live remote lecture, if someone wants, do it,
    otherwise, dont worry bout it 

work breakdown 
- presentation is the priority for us 
- roster
- preparing lecture 

prep, presentation, layers, graphics, roster, communications
have one each for those topics (fisher's reccomendation)

get the details for each class (eg. roster to chat, method names, etc) 

database: dont necessaey for eclass, low amount of info
use vanilla thing to keep track of student
sqlite if you really want to implement database
dont need to worry about security (low priority right now) 
assume users have gone through pre-authentication process
