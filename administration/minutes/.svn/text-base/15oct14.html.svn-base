<i> Look at the UI, and determine what objects could be relevant </i>
<br><br><b> Objects: </b> 
<li> Lectures - slides, title
<li> Roster- students, flags  
<li> Chat - members, chat space 
<li> Layer Manager- Collection of layers -> visibility, name, ink, notes, shapes that get drawn on it 
<li> Drawing tool bar -> Create a drawing class, similar to 102. (For example, you would have shapes will consist of rectangles, ovals, etc. )

<p> Some notes: For chat, name of members in chatroom shown is a good idea. 
<br> In layer class for example, declare primitive types (boolean vis, string name, etc)
<br> The lecture content is best modeled via HTML element. (Mapping that turns the HTML into what will be presented on the screen. Low-level (HTML) vs High-level (Lecture Presentation) )
