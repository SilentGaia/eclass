<em>Round 9 of discussion with customer.</em>
<ol type=1> 
<br> 2.1 - On-screen ; 1 paragraph explanations would be better
<br> 2.2 - Emphasis on pictures, empty -> full. Want it to be clear. html support check. decimal numbering style is not support, but lecture preparer should have an easy way of doing so . 3 styles, standard html, decimal numbering style, and bulleted stuff.
<br> 2.3 - Title page, raw text? Always there? Raw slides would be very good. 
<br> 2.4 - Wants pictures instead of just a bunch of links. SOme visuals would be best. Want to see notetaking visuals. Understands its similar, but needs pocutures.
<br> 2.5 - one picture with every possible shape on it. user issue - different ways you can draw a shape, point vector, drag a line, end of vector is the outer edge of the shape.
<br> 2.6 - visual seperation for the segments
<br> 2.7 - chat-drawing interaction, show pictures of shared drawing in chat. side by side picture of drawing and chat to show a scenario of the interaction. (eg. instructor says draw in blue, green for student 2, and red for student 3, show that scenario)
<br> 2.8 - wants to keep it simple. somehow need to show how remote logins work. private address to access? (acm webinars) little dialog box asking for specialized token to represent a lecture the guest wants to log in to
