This document defines requirements for an electronic classroom, more formally named as the Integrated Classroom Presentation Tool. By managing a repository of classroom materials and allowing students to view them electronically inside and outside of class, the tool facilitates electronic interaction between instructor and students increasing effectiveness and efficiency of current teaching methods. Instructors are given full administrative rights to the tool and will be able to assign mini-administrators for certain roles, such as a note taker, question delegator and artist. 
<p>
By innovating new ways of student interaction within the traditional classroom, the E-Classroom serves to improve current education systems by applying and integrating software engineering concepts and principles to them.
