1.4.  Impacts
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The positive potential impacts of the Electronic Classroom tool as a functioning system are to provide a different approach to instruct students and to adapt to the new technological age. The positive impacts of the Electronic Classroom tool as a course example are:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
a different approach in order to have everyone in the classroom interact;
<p> <li>
support for new types of teaching involving technology;
<p> <li>
having course materials in front of each student rather than dealing with insufficient amount of materials.
</ol>
<p>
Potential negative impacts include those common to any user-oriented software system. If the system is poorly designed and implemented, it can be inconvenient to use and decrease rather than increase classroom productivity. A specific negative impact would be that the computers in front of each student will end up to be a distraction to certain students.
<p>
As a course example, the use of the Electronic Classroom has no significant negative impacts, unless it is taken into account the possibility of distractions. However, such negative impacts can be easily avoided if the instructors decide to limit their students in their actions.
