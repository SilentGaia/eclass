    Executive Summary
    </h4>
The goal of the EClass program is to enhance interaction between students and instructors.  The EClass tool has several functionalities that make it easy for students and instructor's to interact.
<p>
The program is composed of multiple smaller components.  Notable ones include the presentation area, the roster, the chatbox, drawing tools, and the file manager.  The presentation is where an instructor's lecture will appear.  Students and instructors will have the capability to draw onto the lecture slides.  The presentation allows a user to make layers over the presentation being shown.  The roster shows the students currently present in the class.  It is also where priveleges for drawing, chatting, and adminster rights is controlled.  This is closely linked with the chatbox, where students and instructors can chat with each other.  Students will also be able to ask questions through the chatbox, and a notification will appear on the roster for the instructor to address.  The file manager is how instructors will import their lectures into the program, and also how students can view lectures in an offline setting.
</p>
<p> 
Things that may be difficult to implement include creating presentations and properly syncing everyone's program.  Lectures will be created as HTML, and the HTML will be interpreted by the program in order to display a presentation.  It may be tricky interpreting the HTML code, and it could also be difficult to give enough custom options for a presentation.  Syncing may be another difficulty.  Syncing should be relatively fast, and it is unknown how quick it will be in a full classroom setting.
