<h3>
1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>


<p>
The general problems to be addressed by the Electric Classroom project are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Provide a tool for students to participate, interact, and engage directly with a teacherâ€™s lecture
<p> <li>
Provide a way for lectures and notes to seamlessly become a reference, easily accessible by all students
</ol>
There are a few tools out already which would assist in solving some of these issues, but the main features of the electronic classroom would look at the following areas:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
Being able to create layers over the lectures, being able to make slide and ink layers over those on the existing 
<p> <li>
Being able to give students privileges during a class session, allowing them to participate with editing, questioning or problem solving directly with everybody else
<p> <li>
Being able to actively interact not only with the lecture, but every person in the class as well
</ol>
<p>
The Electronic classroom project will address the needs and concerns of a particular customer.  This customer needs a suite of features that may be found with a combination of different softwares, but not available as a single package.
