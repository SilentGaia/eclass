	<h3> 2.4.2. Assigning privileges to students </h3>
	
	<p> Within the main roster layout, the user has the option to control different privileges
		that a certain student may have. That could be the ability to draw on the main presentation,
		the ability to chat with other students via the Chatbox, and finally the ability to administrate 
		the class. 
	</p>
	
	<p> Initially, all students will be denied any privileges. In terms of the roster, the three circles
		to the right of their name on the roster will be red. If any privileges are to be given, the user 
		will have to click the circle indicating which privilege should be allowed, and that circle will 
		change color into green. 
	</p>
	
	<p> Drawing and chatting privileges will not affect the main roster layout. 
		Giving administrative privilege will. 
		<br> A student who has been assigned admin privileges will have a roster layout thats exactly
		the same as the instructors.
