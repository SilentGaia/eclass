2.8.4.   Viewing Overlays
</h4>
</a>
<p>
After a presentation is done and instructor, or the students, themselves wants to view over the slides, including the layers added during the presentation, can be viewed in the <tt>Layers</tt> window and the corresponding slide/layer will also show up on the <tt>Slide</tt> window.
<br>
<br>
To look over a lecture's slide/layers, the user must first open the file as <a href = "opening-file.html">section 2.8.2</a> has demonstrated. Then, all the slides and layers will show up in the <tt>Layers</tt> window as shown in Figure 112.

<hr>
<br>From there, the user can use the scroll bar on the right side of the window to navigate through the lecture or the user can use the navigation bar provided in the <tt>Slide</tt> window to navigate through lecture.
