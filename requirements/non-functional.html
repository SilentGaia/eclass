3. Non-Functional Requirements

<h3> 3.1 System Performance </h3>
<p>
All user interaction with the software will be effectively instantaneous except for syncing involved in drawings. Interactions that are effectively instantaneous includes navigating through a lecture, management of the roster, chatbox interaction, and file management. Syncing drawings is not instantaneous because there will be a delay when a drawing is synced to all other screens. For example, when a student draws on their screen, it is shown immediately. Within a couple of seconds, the drawing will sync with all other users in the class and appear on their individual screens.
<br>
<br>
Computational commands that may take longer to run are importing and exporting presentation files and html-related files. The maximum amount of time allowed to run is 10 seconds. 
<br>
<br>
The maximum size requirements for stored data is 10 courses, where in each course, a max of 50 presentation lecture files can be stored. If the instructor would like to add another course, they must first choose to delete a course. The instructor is allowed to save the deleted course.s information by exporting if he or she would like. 
<br>
</p>
<h3> 3.2 Qualitative System Characteristics </h3>
<p>
For maximum security, the software uses a login method to authenticate all users with access to the software. 
All user data is encrypted and stored on a secure server.
Any guest wishing to observe a classroom must receive a permission number from the instructor of the class to access course features. 
However, guests may only observe lectures and have limited functionality inlcuding restricted access to roster, chat and drawing tools. 
<br>
<br>
Users may expect full privacy when taking notes on private layers or interacting with presentations. 
Yet, users should expect similar privacy as they would in traditional classrooms, where students have access to each others' names and ability to speak or chat with one another. 
For private chats, instructors have the ability to observe them real-time, which displays a special icon in the chatroom viewable to all users in it. 
<br>
<br>
On the simplicity versus power spectrum, the system falls on the simplicity side as most features are simple and intuitive that are designed for less sophisticated users.
The only complex feature in the system is the optional HTML import feature which allows instructors to enter styled lectures.
Therefore, the system is made for the general public consisting of easily-accessible features.
