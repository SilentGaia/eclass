After the user created a lecture file as shown <a href="new-lecture.html">here</a>, the instrutor can then go to the '<tt>Insert Lecture</tt>' window to start creating the lecture. If the window is not already on the screen, the user can open up the window through the task bar as demonstrated <a href="ui-overview.html#Task Bar Utilities">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
When the '<tt>Insert Lecture</tt>' window is up, the user will see a dialog similar to what is shown on Figure 9.

<br>
The newly created lecture will have no slides. To add a slide, the user can click on the '<tt>+</tt>' button located in the middle of the box. When the user clicks on the '<tt>+</tt>' button, the EClass program responds by creatinga new slide and labeling it as <tt>slide 1</tt> as shown in Figure 10. To add more slides to the lecture, the user can continue to click on the '<tt>+</tt>' button.

When the system opens the new window, the slide the user is trying to edit will be raw. If user wants to use a multilevel list, the user can select the pencil icon on the top right corner. Once the user has selected the pencil icon, a box will pop up with different types of multilevel list to choose from as shown in Figure 12.

To add text to the lecture, the user can just double click on the '<tt>+</tt>' button and it will be available to edit.

To insert an image to a lecture slide, the user must first select under which line the image should be under as shown in Figure 18. If the slide is blank, there is no need to select anything.

<br>
The user will then have the ability to navigate through the local computer's files to find the right image to add into the lecture slide. Once the image is found, the user then needs to select the image as shown in Figure 20. When the user selects the wanted image, the window will highlight the image name.

Once the user selects the wanted image, all the user needs to do is click the '<tt>Insert</tt>' button at the bottom right of the window. When the user presses the button, the image will then show in the lecture slide as shown in Figure 21.
