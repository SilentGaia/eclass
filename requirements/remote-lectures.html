<h4>
2.8.  Viewing Lectures Remotely and Offline
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Users of the tool will be able to view lectures remotely as long as they have both the software and an internet connection. The user will simply have to log in to the software, and all the presentations saved on the tool will be available for viewing.  The user will also have the option of downloading a lecture in order to have a copy to view on their machine.  If a presentation is deleted from the tool, it will not be accessible unless an instructor or a student with a local copy imports it into their tool.  

<p>
Various scenarios involving viewing a lecture, including searching for a presentation file, opening a presentation file, organizing files, and viewing a lecture's overlay(s).
