2.6.4. Show/Hide Public Overlays
</h4>
</a>
<p>
When the instructor is giving lecture, the instructor and the students have their own layers. Any layers instructor adds during the presentation is automatically added into the students' layers. Any layers the students add onto their own <tt>Layers</tt> window will only be shown on their screen. For a student's layer to be shown throughout the whole class and the instructor's presentation is when the instructor gives that specific student the privilege to do so as discussed in <a href = "privileges.html">section 2.6.4.</a>
<br>
<br>
When a student is given the privilege to draw, the student or the instructor can add a new layer before doing anything. From there, the student can draw on the layer and the whole class can see and will have the layer added to their own personal <tt>Layers</tt> window. More details on this can be found in <a href = "lecture-layers.html">section 2.3.3.</a> relating to how layers work when added during a presenation.
<br>
<br>After the student is done and the instructor or student does not what the drawing to be visible, the instructor or student can make it invisible. More details about layer visibility can be found in <a href = "layer-visibility.html">section 2.5.2.3.</a>
