2.4.2.  Note-Taking During Lecture
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Many of the tools for a student taking notes during a lecture are directly 
correlated to how an instructor takes notes presenting a lecture, which 
are presented in section <a href="lecture-layers.html">2.3.3.</a>

<p>
The main difference between the student's interface and the instructor's 
interface is the ability of a student to take notes on a slide, depending 
on which mode the instructor sets the class in.

<p>
While the class is in free mode, the student can use drawing tools (explained 
in detail in section <a href="toolbar.html">2.5.</a>) to whichever slide the 
student is taking notes on. When the instructor switches to lock mode, the 
student is on the targeted slide the instructor is presenting and drawing 
tools are disabled. Figure 5 shows the student's current interface while in 
lock mode with the layers manager and drawing tools windows now in grey.
