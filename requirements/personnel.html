1.2.  System Personnel
</h3>
</a>

<p>
The personnel involved in the Electronic Classroom tool are organized into the following groups and subgroups:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
end users
<ol type=i>
<p> <li>
registered users
<p> <li>
user group leaders
<p> <li>
head system administrators
</ol>
<p> <li>
customers
<p> <li>
system developers
<p> <li>
software engineering students
<p> <li>
outside parties
</ol>
<p>
End users are those who intend to use the Electronic Classroom to its fullest potential. Registered users will include students who will be taking the class virtually through the tool. Administrators will include teachers, who will be supplying the lectures and providing additional help through the interface. Students appointed by the teacher will also be categorized as administrators and they will have the same privileges.
<p>
The primary customer is Professor Gene Fisher. He will provide the necessary requirements for our tool as well as provide sufficient support in determining other features that should be incorporated. As a representative of Cal Polytechnic State University, he will consult with other instructors and allow their ideas to be integrated as well.
<p>
The primary systems developer will be also be Professor Gene Fisher. His development activities follow through the software development process. Members working on the project are minor systems developers, because they too will follow the same software development process, including project design, project management, and so forth. 
<p>
Software engineering students are the ones who will be working on the Electronic Classroom tool, relating information given to by the customer, and implementing the design. 
<p>
All outside parties will have free access to the Electronic Classroom tool for their collective use. The project directory is located at
