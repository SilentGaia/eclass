1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>
There is one operational setting for the Electronic Classroom: (1) a pre-configured room with computers for each student and the teacher.
<p>
The Electronic Classroom tool is intended to be used in order to teach a class in any physical space that is preconfigured with computers. As such, the preconfigured room should have a local network in which all the computers will be able to connect to. The tool will work on any pre-existing system as long as the previous criteria is met. The setting for which it is appropriately suited is a computer lab of some form, where each student and the teacher should have his or her own computer.
<p>
As noted in the preceding section on system personnel, there is a single primary customer for the Electronic Classroom tool, and as such, the tools reflect the point of view of the customer base. The customer has consciously made an effort to emphasize that the tool should work in a preconfigured classroom.
<p>
The Electronic Classroom tool has been designed to fit any general classroom curriculum. Other instructors should find the toolâ€™s usage and functionality to be of ease.
