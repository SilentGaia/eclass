2.1.  User Interface Overview

<p>
When the user initially invokes the EClassroom tool, the screen appears as shown
in Figure 1.

The initial display consists of six windows: a display of the current active 
presentation, a navigation window for the presentation, multiple toolbars 
(for note-taking, layer management, file management, and lecture editing), 
and a taskbar that contains two collapsed windows (a chat and a roster).  
The heading for all active windows (including minimized windows) is 
highlighted with a widened border.  
<p>
Figure 2 shows an expansion of each windows tasks.

<p>
<tt>Drawing Tools</tt> is a toolbox window available for users to take notes, 
using a lecture slide as the canvas. The different tools available are overlays 
for writing or drawing on a lecture slide, a drawing tool for drawing brush 
strokes, a note-object tool for adding "post-it" notes, a selector tool for 
selecting Drawing Tool objects to modify, a text tool for typing, and a shape 
tool for drawing predefined shapes onto the lecture slide.
</p><p>
<tt>Lecture Editor</tt> is a task window that allows for the creation of new 
presentations through pre-formatted layout lecture content or through an 
HTML editor for custom layouts of a slide.
</p><p>
<tt>Roster</tt> is a task window with a list of registered students in the 
classroom and the options for what each student is able to do in the 
classroom. For example, there are flags for whether a student is able to 
draw on a lecture slide or interact in the class chat. There is also a flag 
for whether a student user has the option to manage the roster as well, 
indicating the student to be a TA. If a student has a question (asked in 
the Chat), the instructor will be notified through the Roster.
</p><p>
<tt>Presentation/Navigation</tt> is a dual-window combination that is the main 
view for the instructor to present a lecture, for a student to view and take 
notes on a lecture, or for the class to view the current public layer the 
instructor has assigned. Navigation windows allows for the student to navigate 
through a lecture while the instructor is lecturing on a separate slide.
</p><p>
<tt>File Manager</tt> allows for either the creation of new presentations 
(with the help of the Lecture Editor) or imports of a previously-made 
presentation from the program's database or from the user's local computer.
</p><p>
<tt>Layer Manager</tt> is a task window the user interacts with to sort 
the layers of Drawing Tool objects and notes taken for a specific lecture 
slide. The tools provided gives the user the ability to change the opacity 
of the background of a layer or the opacity of the objects in a given layer.
</p><p>
<tt>Chat</tt> is the main interaction window between students and instructor. 
Users are able to participate in the main Class chat or have separate chats 
for partner or team work. A user also asks questions, both privately and 
publicly, in the Class chat.

</a>
<p>
The task bar interface for users is a way to toggle the displays of 
the different task windows. After start up, the initial display has the
presentation, navigation, drawing tools, lecture insertions, overlay tool, 
and file manager task windows expanded. The roster and the chatbox are 
initially collapsed and are accessible through the icons represented in 
the task bar interface.

<p>Figure 3 shows the fixed display of the task bar interface.</p>
<p>
Typical `<tt>Edit</tt>' menu commands such as `<tt>Save</tt>', 
`<tt>Undo</tt>', and `<tt>Redo</tt>' are displayed as image icons 
in the task bar interface to the right of the task window icons.
</p>
To the far most right of the task bar interface, the instructor-user 
interface chooses the lock icon to put the entire class of student-users 
into "lockdown mode". This mode lets the instructor present and/or edit 
lectures freely while students have no access to the program at all.
