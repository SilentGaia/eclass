<h3> 2.6.2. Attendance </h3>

<p>
There are color bubble indicators to the left of the student's name to show the active status of a student. 
<br>A red bubble indicates that the student has not logged in yet, or is offline. Offline student names are slightly greyed out. 
<br>A green bubble on the other hand indicates that the student has checked in and is present. 
<br>A blue bubble indicates that the user in the roster is a user who remotely logged in. That user is a guest of the lecture. 
<br>A question mark indicates that the student has a question for the instructor. (See <a href= "queuing.html"> question queuing</a>)

<br><br> Student's view of the roster can be seen in <a href = "privileges.html">here</a>. There is no major difference, except in some administrative features being greyed out. 

<p>
Figure 71 is what the instructor's roster window looks like once E-Class starts. The bubbles next to all students' names are all red indicating that no student is present. 
<br> Lecture guest Clint Staley has a blue bubble indicator to the left of his name.

<br>When a student successfully logs into E-Class, their attendance bubble indicator changes color accordingly and become green. They are automatically shifted up within the roster to the top,
for the ease of the instructor to see whose present. In Figure 72, a student A (Carmen Dang) is able to successfully login, and her attendance bubble changes from red to green. 

<p><i>For the purpose of attendance, remote guests bubble indicators are always blue as long as they are present in the lecture. 
<br>If a remote user disconnects, their name is removed from the roster list. The following figures only relate to a student's attendance changing.

As another student logins, E-Class updates the roster automatically. In Figure 73, student B (Tammy Kong) checks in. 
Her name moves up the list of roster, passed the absent students. 
<br> It is easier to differentiate which side of the roster has the attendants versus the absent. 
<br> Both sections of online and offline individuals are still alphabetically sorted.

<br><br>The instructor easily distinguishes which one of his/her students is absent and which ones are present. 
<br>By scanning the roster for a red indicator, attendance checking is a simple task.
