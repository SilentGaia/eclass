Once the chatbox icon is clicked, the chatbox grows to full size as shown in Figure 86.
On the left side of the chatbox window, there is a list of chatrooms available to the user, which are all clickable for navigation.
By default, the chatbox directs the user to the classroom tab, which includes everyone on the roster and the instructor.

As chatrooms may include more than two users, the list of people in chatrooms are shorted with the <tt>...</tt> symbol. 
This way, when the chatroom tab with the names are clicked, it navigates the user to the chatroom where the user can see the list of people, add people and leave the room, as shown in Figure 88.
